###Notes
* Page 12: Self-driving car sensors:- Radar, Visible-light camera, LIDAR, Infrared camera, Stereo vision, 
    GPS/IMU, CAN, Audio
* Page 13: 6 problems in self-driving: Perception, Localization, Mapping, control, path planning,
driver state.
* Page 39: Significant progress in field of computer Vision fueled by Deep Learning. Some of the 
  applications 
  * Object Classification 
  * Object Segmentation and Localization 
  * Colorization of Images 
  * Automatic Translation of Text in Images
* Page 45: recurrent neural network can generate images/text rather than just classifying something.
  [Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNN](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
  * Handwriting Generation
  * Character level Test Generation 
  * Image caption Generation 
  * Image Question Answering 
  * Video Description generation 
  * Adding Audio to silent films 
* For Machine, Easy problems are hard(Soccer is harder than Chess)
* Neural nets can be fooled by little distortion 
* 5 year plan for Deep Learning 
    * Deeper Model: Model that need fewer example for training.
    * So efficient to run on mobile devices.
    * Significant advances in Deep unsupervised learning and deep reinforcement learning.
    * Can summarize what happened in a video clip. Can model behaviour of genes, drugs and 
    medicine and then be used to design new medicines.
    * An increase in multi-modal learning. learning from multiple datasets.
    * Deep Learning be ported into Commercial products.
* Dangers !
    * Camera Spoofind 
    * LIDAR Spoofing
